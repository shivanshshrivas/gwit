## Threat Model

gwit is a **local developer tool** that runs under your own user account. It does not
run as a server, does not accept network connections, and does not store credentials.

### What gwit protects against

- **Shell injection** via branch names, paths, or config values reaching `execSync`
- **Path traversal** in `.gwitinclude` file lists escaping the repository
- **Env var injection** of `$GWIT_*` values into shell command strings
- **World-readable secrets** in config (`~/.gwitrc`) and registry (`~/.gwit/`)
- **Socket leaks** during port probing

### What gwit does not protect against

- **Malicious hook files** — `.gwitcommand` and `.gwitcleanup` are shell scripts
  committed to your repository. If you clone a repository from an untrusted source
  and run `gwit`, those files will execute. See [Hook Execution](#hook-execution--trust-model).
- **Concurrent write races** — if two `gwit` processes write the registry at exactly
  the same millisecond, one write may win. The write-and-rename strategy makes this
  safe for single-process use; multi-process locking is deferred to a future release.
- **Compromised `git` binary** — all git operations shell out to the `git` CLI on
  `$PATH`. A malicious `git` binary could intercept any command.
- **Privilege escalation** — gwit runs as the invoking user and performs no
  `sudo` or `setuid` operations.

---

## Shell Injection Prevention

gwit calls the git CLI for every repository operation. The central risk is a branch
name or path containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&&`, `$(...)`, backticks)
reaching an `execSync` string interpolation.

### The two function families in `lib/shell.ts`

| Function | Underlying API | Shell involved? | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run(string)` | `execSync` | **Yes** — `/bin/sh -c` | Static commands with no user input |
| `runSafe(string)` | `execSync` | **Yes** | Same, returns `{success}` instead of throwing |
| `runArgs(cmd, args[])` | `spawnSync` | **No** — direct `execve` | Any command that takes user-provided data |
| `runArgsSafe(cmd, args[])` | `spawnSync` | **No** | Same, never throws |
| `runArgsInherited(cmd, args[])` | `spawnSync` | **No** | Output piped to terminal |

### Policy

All functions that accept user-controlled data — branch names, worktree paths, ref
names — use the `runArgs` / `runArgsSafe` family. The string-interpolating `run` and
`runSafe` are used only for static, literal commands with no external input.

**Example — safe branch checkout:**

```typescript
// BAD — branch name reaches the shell
run(`git worktree add ${worktreePath} ${branch}`)

// GOOD — arguments are passed as an array, never seen by a shell
runArgs('git', ['worktree', 'add', worktreePath, branch])
```

### Audit scope

All 14 `git` call sites in `src/core/git.ts` were audited. The two that previously
used string interpolation (`branchExistsRemote`, `isBranchMerged`) were converted to
`runArgsSafe` before the v0.1.0 release.

---

## Environment Variable Safety

gwit injects seven `$GWIT_*` environment variables into each worktree process:

| Variable | Example value |
|---|---|
| `GWIT_BRANCH` | `feature/auth` |
| `GWIT_SLUG` | `feature_auth` |
| `GWIT_PORT` | `3002` |
| `GWIT_DB_SUFFIX` | `_feature_auth` |
| `GWIT_WORKTREE_PATH` | `/home/user/myapp-feature_auth` |
| `GWIT_MAIN_PATH` | `/home/user/myapp` |
| `GWIT_INDEX` | `2` |

### Injection rule

These values are **always passed via the `env` option** to `execSync` / `spawnSync`,
never string-interpolated into a command string:

```typescript
// BAD — GWIT_PORT inside a shell string is a shell variable expansion,
//       but if the value contained metacharacters it could inject commands
execSync(`createdb myapp_${env.GWIT_DB_SUFFIX}`)

// GOOD — the shell expands $GWIT_DB_SUFFIX from the environment,
//         the value never touches the command string at all
execSync('createdb myapp$GWIT_DB_SUFFIX', {
  env: { ...process.env, ...env },
})
```

Your hook scripts in `.gwitcommand` and `.gwitcleanup` receive these variables in
their environment and reference them with normal shell `$VAR` syntax. The values gwit
produces are derived from branch names, which are validated by git itself before the
worktree is created.

---

## Path Traversal Prevention

### `.gwitinclude` file copying

`gwit create` copies gitignored files listed in `.gwitinclude` from your main worktree
into the new one (e.g. `.env`, `node_modules/`, local databases). Each entry goes
through three guards before any filesystem operation:

1. **Absolute path rejection** — entries starting with `/` or a drive letter are
   skipped immediately. `path.join` would otherwise collapse them to an absolute path
   that escapes the repository.

2. **Containment check** — the resolved path is compared to the repository root using
   `path.relative()`. If the relative path begins with `..` or is itself absolute,
   the entry is skipped. This catches inputs like `../../etc/passwd` regardless of
   how many traversal components they use.

3. **Symlink safety** — `fs.cpSync` is called with `dereference: false` (the default
   in Node 20+, now also explicit). Symlinks inside a copied directory are reproduced
   as symlinks in the destination, not followed to their targets.

```
Entry: "../../etc/passwd"
→ path.relative('/home/user/myapp', '/etc/passwd') → '../../etc/passwd'
→ starts with '..' → SKIP (path escapes repo)

Entry: "/etc/passwd"
→ path.isAbsolute('/etc/passwd') === true → SKIP (absolute path not allowed)

Entry: ".env"
→ relative('.env') → '.env'  (stays inside repo) → PROCEED
```

### Worktree placement

Worktree paths are constructed from the main repo path and a sanitised slug derived
from the branch name. `toSlug()` reduces branch names to `[a-z0-9_]` characters
before any path is constructed, so directory traversal via a crafted branch name is
not possible.

---

## File Permissions

gwit stores two user-specific files on disk:

| File | Content | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.gwitrc` | editor command, base port, worktree location | `0o600` (owner read/write) |
| `~/.gwit/worktrees.json` | all active worktree paths, ports, slugs | `0o600` |
| `~/.gwit/` directory | contains the registry | `0o700` (owner only) |

Permissions are applied with `fs.chmodSync` after every write. On Windows, where
Unix-style mode bits are not supported, the `chmod` call is wrapped in a `try/catch`
and silently skipped — the NTFS ACL model is relied on instead.

The registry temp file (`worktrees.json.tmp.<pid>.<random>`) is also `chmod`-ed to
`0o600` **before** it is renamed over the target, ensuring the target is never
transiently world-readable even on systems with a permissive umask.

---

## Hook Execution — Trust Model

### What hooks are

gwit supports two hook files committed to your repository root:

| File | When it runs | Failure behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `.gwitcommand` | After `gwit create` — inside the new worktree | Stops on first error |
| `.gwitcleanup` | During `gwit remove` — inside the worktree being removed | Warns and continues |

Typical uses: `npm install`, `createdb myapp$GWIT_DB_SUFFIX`, `cp .env.example .env`.

### The trust requirement

Because hook commands are arbitrary shell strings executed with `execSync`, **gwit
treats the repository as fully trusted**. Before running `gwit create` in a repository
you did not author or review, inspect these files:

```bash
cat .gwitcommand
cat .gwitcleanup
```

This is the same trust model as `npm install` (which runs `postinstall` scripts) and
`make` (which runs arbitrary Makefile targets).

### Disabling hooks

If you want to create a worktree without running hook commands:

```bash
gwit create <branch> --no-commands   # skip .gwitcommand
```

Cleanup hooks can be reviewed before `gwit remove` by reading `.gwitcleanup` in the
main worktree.

### What hooks cannot do

- Hooks cannot inject data into gwit's own process or registry — they run in a child
  process after the worktree is fully created.
- The `$GWIT_*` environment variables are read-only from the hook's perspective;
  any changes the hook makes to them are not visible to gwit.
- Hook failures during setup leave the worktree directory intact so you can debug
  without losing work.

---

## Registry Integrity

The registry (`~/.gwit/worktrees.json`) tracks all active worktrees across all
repositories. It is a JSON file managed exclusively by gwit.

### Atomic writes

The registry is updated using a **write-and-rename** strategy to prevent corruption
from interrupted writes:

1. A temp file is written: `worktrees.json.tmp.<pid>.<random>` — the PID and random
   suffix prevent collisions between concurrent gwit processes.
2. `fs.renameSync` atomically replaces the target. On POSIX this is an atomic
   `rename(2)` syscall. On Windows it uses `MoveFileEx` with
   `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`, which is atomic for same-volume moves.
3. If rename fails (e.g. cross-device move), it retries up to three times with a
   100 ms delay before giving up and cleaning up the temp file.

### Corrupt registry recovery

If the registry file contains invalid JSON (e.g. truncated by a crash):

1. The file is copied to `worktrees.json.bak` before being discarded.
2. gwit starts with an empty registry and logs a warning.
3. Existing worktree directories are not affected — they can be re-registered with
   `gwit create` or removed with `gwit remove`.

To restore manually: `cp ~/.gwit/worktrees.json.bak ~/.gwit/worktrees.json`

---

## Port Allocation

`gwit create` assigns each worktree a unique TCP port for its development server.

### Allocation strategy

1. All ports currently assigned to any registered gwit worktree across all repos are
   collected from the registry.
2. Starting from `basePort` (default: 3001), each candidate port is checked:
   - Skipped if already in the assigned set.
   - Probed with a TCP `net.createServer().listen()` to confirm it is not already
     in use by another process.
3. The scan covers at most 100 ports. If none are free, gwit exits with an error.

### Probe safety

- The probe server binds to `127.0.0.1` only, never `0.0.0.0`, to avoid briefly
  exposing the port on the network.
- The server is closed immediately after a successful bind — it holds the port for
  less than one event loop tick.
- On `EACCES` or other socket errors, the server is explicitly closed before the
  promise resolves to prevent file descriptor leaks.

## Input Validation

### Branch names

Branch names are validated indirectly by git itself: `git worktree add` rejects any
name that git considers invalid. gwit does not impose additional restrictions beyond
requiring the branch resolves to a local or remote ref.

### Config values (`gwit config set`)

| Key | Validation |
|---|---|
| `editor` | Non-empty string; shell metacharacters (`;`, `&`, `\|`, `` ` ``, `$`, `(`, `)`, etc.) are rejected to guard against injection if the value is later used in a string-interpolated context. |
| `location` | Enum — must be exactly `sibling` or `subdirectory`. |
| `basePort` | Integer in range 1–65535 (`parseInt` + range check). |

### `.gwitinclude` entries

Entries are trimmed and blank/comment lines are stripped. Absolute paths and
path-traversal sequences are rejected as described in
[Path Traversal Prevention](#path-traversal-prevention).

## Dependency Surface

gwit's runtime dependency tree is intentionally minimal:

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `commander` | ^12.1.0 | CLI argument parsing |
| `inquirer` | ^8.2.6 | Interactive first-run setup |

No network requests are made at runtime. No eval or dynamic code loading occurs.
All git operations shell out to the `git` binary already present on the system.

Dependencies are pinned to minor-version ranges (`^`) to receive patch security
fixes automatically via `npm update`, while avoiding unintentional major-version
breaking changes.
